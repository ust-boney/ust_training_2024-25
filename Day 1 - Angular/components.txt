Angular applications are created in pieces - called components

we create separate component for every uniqe functionality
eg.

SearchFlights
Book
Bokkinghistory
paymentdetails
userprofile
aboutapp
contactus

thus application is made up of all this component

Component : is like a plug in, reusable, injectable 

Component is made of files
	.html
	.css
	.ts
	.spec.ts (for testing)

application comes with 1 default component - App, we will create more now using angular cli command
------------------------------
create new application bookingApp
ng new bookingApp
cd bookingApp
cd src\app
mkdir components
cd components

ng g c searchflight
ng g c book
ng g c bookinghistory
ng g c userprofile
ng g c aboutus
ng g c contactus

-------
check all the folder under src\app u will find all the folders has .html, .css,.ts,.spec.ts

let us go to about us component and add some properties



in aboutus.component.ts
aboutusDetails = " lots of contents here from web "
componentName = "About us";


display the same in aboutus.component.html
<h1> {{ componentName }} </h1>
<p> {{ aboutusDetails }} </p>

add some css h1{color:blue}
------


time to use/inject the component in app 

in app.component.ts, import the component like u did ngFor

in import 
	imports: [RouterOutlet,AboutusComponent], (use tab so below line gets included on its own by IDE)
	import { AboutusComponent } from './components/aboutus/aboutus.component';

in app.component.html
	 <app-aboutus></app-aboutus>
